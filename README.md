### Problem Statement

Every year over 3000  hackathons are organized both online and offline and the networking and team building phase is what escalates the hackathon overall experience for the Hackers but most of the Hackers are unaware of who all are there in the Hackathon and many times miss to connect with folks or fails to form a right team to ace the hackathon

## Discovery Phase

While forming team for HackMOL 3.0 we were searching for backend developer and we had hustle a lot for finding one who was not only a backend developer but also wants to participate in the hackathon and we found the same issue with other teams and hackers participating

## Solution Proposed

To help Hackers to build strong teams in order to ace the hackathons we brought a platform where Hackers can find a team to join and list their teams to onboard the best fit members through our website and discord bot
